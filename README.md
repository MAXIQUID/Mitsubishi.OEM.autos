# Mitsubishi.OEM.autos

A curated and structured repository of **Mitsubishi vehicle data**, originally based on the `Cars-Mitsubishi` collection.
This repo leverages FiveM vehicle configurations as **surrogate digital twins** of real Mitsubishi models — enabling structured OEM mapping, reverse engineering, and lifecycle simulation.

Most late-model make/models were already available in public **FiveM car packs**, which made cloning and adapting these repositories a convenient starting point for building structured digital representations.

Part of the broader `OEM.autos` ecosystem by **TWENTYTHIRTY**.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Repurpose FiveM vehicle data as **digital twins** for real Mitsubishi models
* Link and extract OEM part mappings, group indexes, and trim configurations
* Enable simulation, teardown visualization, and virtual repair planning
* Serve as a backend reference for structured automotive applications

## 📁 Structure

* `vehicles/` — Digital twin configs per Mitsubishi model (adapted from FiveM)
* `foe_exports/` — Factory Original Equipment (FOE) flat JSON part data
* `resources/` — Logos, trim metadata, and linked imagery
* `meta/` — Model indexing, historical mapping, and versioning

## 🔧 Use Cases

* Circular economy lifecycle modeling
* Digital teardown mapping
* OEM vs aftermarket comparison
* Educational tools for virtual automotive training
